# GShop
GShop was a prototype version of GStore (gstore1.github.io) that was scrapped and replaced with GStore. This website hosts the old website of GShop, one of the many prototype websites.
This also hosts the placeholder logo that was in use when GShop was scrapped.

# GStore

Go to GStore if you actually plan to buy or do much. https://gstore1.github.io
